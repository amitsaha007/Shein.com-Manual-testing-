## :boom: What is this project about?
This project contains test cases, scenarios, mindmaps, reports, and test metrics for a US based e-commerce website known as www.shein.com.us. 
It serves as a comprehensive resource for manual testers to effectively plan, execute, and track their testing efforts

## :golf: Why was this project created?
The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of test cases that cover different aspects of Shein.com, including but not limited to browsing products, adding items to cart, checkout process, user account management, and site responsiveness.


## :bulb:  Test Cases 
The test cases are organized into different categories based on the features and functionalities of Shein.com.
 Each test case should include the following information:

-Test case ID
-Test case description
-Pre-requisites
-Test steps
-Expected results
-Actual results (to be filled during test execution)


## :star: Scenarios
The scenarios consists of detailed scenarios that represent different user workflows or use cases within the system. Scenarios help testers understand the system's behavior from end-users' perspectives and ensure that all user interactions are thoroughly tested.

## :star: Mindmaps
The mindmaps contains visual representations in the form of mindmaps. These mindmaps serve as a visual aid to understand the test coverage, dependencies between different features, and potential areas of focus during testing. Testers can use mindmaps to brainstorm ideas, track testing progress, and identify any gaps in their testing efforts.

## :star: Reports
The reports are dedicated to storing various reports generated during manual testing. Reports may include defect reports, test execution reports, test summary reports, and any other relevant documentation. These reports provide valuable insights into the testing progress, identified issues, and overall test results.

## :star: Test Metrics
The test-metrics contains metrics and measurements related to manual testing. Testers can track metrics such as test coverage, defect density, test execution time, and other relevant metrics to assess the quality and progress of testing activities. The metrics help identify areas of improvement and provide quantitative data for making informed decisions.
